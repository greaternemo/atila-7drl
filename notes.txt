Author: constructs the story. 
The Author holds the logic that simulates the game and compiles the outcome into a Story.

Story: is the story???
The Story is the construct that holds the structure of the simulated game, composed of Vignettes.

Vignette: comprises the story
Each Vignette is a self-contained encounter, a short story, that plays out according to the Author's simulation.

Where do we put the logic to 'play' the game?
Author, right?
